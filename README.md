Recreating Jian Yang's Not Hot Dog app with tf2, fastAPI and React.js

This is an end-to-end ML project covering model training to deployment. We'll try to add more features to it later, and make it work on iOS and Android. 

Steps (working on it)
 - Model training : tensorflow2
 - Model deployment : fastAPI
 - Front-end : React.js

Later : total replication of the app. And recreation of the classic scene.
